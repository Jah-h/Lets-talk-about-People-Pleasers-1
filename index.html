  <h2>A people pleaser is a person who consistently strives to please others, often sacrificing their own wants or needs
    in the process. People-pleasing is difficult to stop. A person with a strong urge to please may feel they need to be
    whatever others want them to be. They may cover up how they really feel or agree to too many favors often ending up
    with not enough time for themselves. A person may feel temporarily good after they please someone, but this feeling
    does not last. They may need to continue doing things for others to feel useful or loved. Ultimately, this harms
    them, as they have fewer resources to take care of themselves.</h2>

      <p>There are many various reasons that may cause someone to develop people pleasing habits. Such reasons may stem
        even from childhood. People pleasing behaviors evolve as a way to maintain connection and closeness with parents
        who are inconsistently available to their children. A lack of parental attunement is a big part of what causes
        people pleasing. Many times, parents of people pleasers are too worried about their own troubles to tune in to
        what their children are feeling and thinking. on another note, people pleasing isnt only developed from a young
        age and can be a picked up habit for its own list of reasons like; Fear of rejection, Worrying too much about
        what others think, fearful of saying no, setting limits, or seeming “mean”. But overall in most cases the
        primary reason is fear of rejection or a want to be accepted or appreciated.</p>

      <p>Its not hard to Identify who people pleasers are, often times they want to stand out in a good way for reasons
        we already know. Some main things that you may notice about a person that may give away that theyre a people
        pleaser kind of person are, they are hungry for the approval of others, they are often stuck in relationships
        where they give more than they get, they are constantly exhausted, overbooked, and burned out trying to take
        care of others, or they are neglectful of their own needs. People with certain personality types are also more
        prone to being people pleasers subconsciously than others. Of course not many people will people please in the
        same way and some may do it for different reasons than others so take these comments with a grain of salt.</p>

      <h2>How To Stop</h2>

      <p>here's nothing inherently wrong with being nice or kind to someone else. In fact, it's a pretty valuable trait.
      But it can also be something we do to avoid disappointing others or put pressure on ourselves to live up to an
      ideal image. A lot of people-pleasers consciously choose to act this way because they are afraid of upsetting
      others. It is a great way to avoid conflict, but in the long run it will leave you feeling drained and unhappy.
      It's hard to be true to yourself when you're always changing your actions and words based on what you think other
      people want. So in the case that this is you and you wish to learn how to stop or want to provide your friend with
      ways on hows to stop heres some ways. For starters the most overly said one is Learn to say "NO". I know often
      times especially after youve let the habit grow for awhile it feels super hard to say NO however I would
      reccommend starting to try to say not to smaller things before flat out cancelling all your plans, take things one
      step at a time yknow?</p>
      <p> Second of all Be true to yourself instead of trying to fit in. The most important thing to
      remember about your behavior is to stay true to yourself. Avoid doing something just because it'll make you look
      good in someone else's eyes, and stick to what you know is right for you. If you've been put on the spot and asked
      to do something that you don't feel comfortable with, don't be afraid to stand your ground. It shows that you are
      strong enough to make your own decisions and it mostly keeps preople from trying to drag you everywhere. Set
      healthy boundaries, This might seem difficult at first, but it is important that you start noticing what is
      happening and identify things that need to change. Make a list of the things you are doing that make you feel
      unhappy or used, like getting coffee for a coworker, and rank them in order of importance with the most
      significant items on top. This simple strategy can allow you to remain true to yourself without feeling the need
      to please everyone. Boundaries give you the ability to say "no" when another person asks for help or takes
      advantage of your time. Remember, you are not selfish--you are just confident enough in who you are that you know
      it's okay not to agree with someone's requests all the time.</p>
